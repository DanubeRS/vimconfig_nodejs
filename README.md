# Danubers node.js VIM configuration
This is my configuration. The configuration is my own. I will cherish it, and let it grow, and may it carry on long after I perish for the world to benefit. </soppy>
## Plugins
There are many plugins that this configuration will revolve into a nice concise (and hopefully not too boated) VDE (VIM Development Environment). They are as follows, in no particular order;
### Core
*[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
### Color Schemes
*[Molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
### General
*[Node.vim](https://github.com/moll/vim-node)
